A call has been issued to embark on a digital transformation journey in a village situated on the outskirts of Rustenburgâ€”a village renowned for its world-class standards and embodying the spirit of UBUNTU.

Phokeng, the homeland of the Dew people, is making yet another remarkable stride towards becoming Africa's innovation hub. While this call may seem audacious, a closer look at the steps they have taken thus far to express such confidence in their vision will shed light on their determination.

Phokeng is celebrated for its exceptional facilities and boasts a unique claim to fame as the only village to have hosted a FIFA World Cup event. The year 2010 witnessed the world bearing witness to the capabilities and unity of the Bafokeng nation as thousands of football enthusiasts flocked to the village. The year preceding this momentous event saw the unveiling of their pride, the Marange Sports Campus, to the global stage. To this day, it continues to host some of the most esteemed football clubs in the region.

With their sights firmly set on the future, the Bafokeng nation has once again taken a bold step, this time in the realm of technology. Over recent years, initiatives encouraging young people to explore opportunities in the tech industry have been established and met with great success. As an exciting development, a hall filled with 50 no-code students is set to produce future JavaScript Engineers. This is just the beginning, and the possibilities for the Bafokeng nation are limited only by their own aspirations.

We watch in awe as this singular village once again embraces the world stage. The Empire continues to flourish, driven by their unwavering spirit and determination.
